# AllCodeRelay Webhook Gallery

Welcome to the AllCodeRelay Webhook Gallery! This collection showcases various webhook implementations that demonstrate the versatility of the AllCodeRelay app for different use cases.

## What is AllCodeRelay?

AllCodeRelay is a universal code scanner app that can scan barcodes, QR codes, Data Matrix, Aztec codes, and read NFC tags. When a code is scanned, the app sends the data to a configured webhook endpoint, allowing for powerful automation and integration possibilities.

## How Webhooks Work

When AllCodeRelay scans a code, it sends a POST request to your webhook URL with this format:

```json
{
  "code": "SCANNED_CODE_VALUE"
}
```

Your webhook should respond with:

```json
{
  "code": "CODE_TYPE",
  "codevalue": "PROCESSED_RESPONSE"
}
```
