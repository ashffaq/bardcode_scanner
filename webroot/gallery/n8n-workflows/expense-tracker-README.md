## How It Works

### Workflow Steps

1. **Webhook Receives Scan**: AllCodeRelay sends scanned code
2. **Data Extraction**: Extracts code and timestamp
3. **Receipt Detection**: Checks if code looks like a receipt/invoice
4. **Data Fetching**: Downloads receipt data if it's a URL
5. **AI Parsing**: OpenAI extracts structured expense data
6. **Validation**: Ensures required fields are present
7. **Logging**: Saves to Google Sheets and sends Slack notification
8. **Response**: Returns formatted response to AllCodeRelay

### Supported Receipt Types

- **QR Codes**: Receipt QR codes with embedded data
- **URLs**: Links to digital receipts
- **Invoice Links**: Online invoice pages
- **Receipt Apps**: Links from receipt scanning apps

## Usage Examples

### Scanning a Receipt QR Code

When you scan a receipt QR code:

```
üí∞ Expense Logged!

üè™ Starbucks Coffee
üíµ $12.45 USD
üìÖ 2024-12-15
üè∑Ô∏è Food & Beverages

‚úÖ Added to expense tracker
```

### Invalid Receipt

For non-receipt codes:

```
‚ùì Not a Receipt

This doesn't appear to be a receipt or invoice.

Please scan:
‚Ä¢ Receipt QR codes
‚Ä¢ Invoice URLs
‚Ä¢ Digital receipt links
```

### Processing Error

If AI can't parse the receipt:

```
‚ùå Invalid Receipt

Missing required fields: merchant, amount

Please scan a valid receipt or invoice.
```

## Configuration Options

### AI Model Settings

In the "AI Receipt Parser" node, you can adjust:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "temperature": 0.1,
  "max_tokens": 1000
}
```

### Expense Categories

The AI automatically categorizes expenses, but you can customize categories by modifying the prompt:

```
Common categories:
- Food & Beverages
- Transportation
- Office Supplies
- Entertainment
- Travel
- Utilities
- Healthcare
- Shopping
```

### Slack Channel

Update the Slack notification node to post to your preferred channel:

```json
{
  "channel": "#expenses",
  "text": "Custom message format..."
}
```

## Google Sheets Output

The workflow creates entries with these fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Date | Transaction date | 2024-12-15 |
| Merchant | Store/vendor name | Starbucks Coffee |
| Amount | Total amount | 12.45 |
| Currency | Currency code | USD |
| Category | Expense category | Food & Beverages |
| Items | Purchased items | Coffee, Muffin |
| Tax | Tax amount | 1.12 |
| Payment Method | How paid | Credit Card |
| Scan Time | When scanned | 2024-12-15T14:30:00Z |
| Original Code | Raw scanned data | https://receipt.url |

## Advanced Features

### Custom Receipt Parsing

Modify the AI prompt to extract additional fields:

```
Extract these additional fields:
- "tip_amount": "tip amount as number"
- "receipt_number": "receipt/transaction ID"
- "cashier": "cashier name if available"
```

### Expense Approval Workflow

Extend the workflow to add approval steps:

1. Add "Set" node to mark expenses as "Pending"
2. Send approval request via email/Slack
3. Add webhook for approval responses
4. Update status in Google Sheets

### Budget Tracking

Add budget monitoring:

```javascript
// In a Code node after logging expense
const monthlyBudget = 1000;
const currentMonth = new Date().getMonth();

// Query Google Sheets for current month total
// Compare against budget
// Send alert if over budget
```

### Receipt Image Storage

Store receipt images in Google Drive:

1. Add "Google Drive" node
2. Upload receipt images
3. Add Drive link to Google Sheets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify sufficient credits
   - Monitor rate limits

2. **Google Sheets Permission Denied**
   - Ensure OAuth credentials are valid
   - Check spreadsheet sharing permissions
   - Verify spreadsheet ID is correct

3. **Receipt Not Recognized**
   - Ensure receipt contains structured data
   - Check if URL is accessible
   - Verify receipt format is supported

4. **Slack Notifications Not Working**
   - Check Slack app permissions
   - Verify channel exists
   - Ensure bot is added to channel

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in n8n:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Log Level**
2. Set to "debug"
3. Check execution logs for detailed information

### Testing Without Receipts

Test the workflow with sample data:

```json
{
  "code": "https://example.com/sample-receipt"
}
```

## Integration Examples

### Expense Report Generation

Create monthly expense reports:

1. Add scheduled trigger (monthly)
2. Query Google Sheets for current month
3. Generate PDF report
4. Email to accounting team

### Multi-Currency Support

Handle international expenses:

1. Add currency conversion API
2. Convert all amounts to base currency
3. Store both original and converted amounts

### Tax Calculation

Automatically calculate tax deductions:

1. Categorize business vs personal expenses
2. Calculate deductible amounts
3. Generate tax summary reports

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Store securely in n8n credentials
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure receipt data is handled securely
3. **Access Control**: Limit Google Sheets access
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all expense modifications

## Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**: Group multiple receipts
2. **Caching**: Cache merchant categorizations
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits
4. **Error Retry**: Implement retry logic
